    Basically, <b>nature</b> never failed to inspire and instigate me. My entire school days, I spent pretty much all the time upstairs. It was a place, where I wondered about life, studied so <i>studiously</i>, read <i> novels</i>, <i>star</i> gazed, talked for hours with friends on <i>call</i>, and what not. We people, as a family used to spend a lot of happy time together. It became a little less when college started. Instead of walking upstairs, I started using <b>the phone</b>. Whoa! It slowly became more comfortable to lie down and use phone or sit somewhere often times in a lazy way. Slowly, there was no time to do anything else. <b>Hobbies</b> and <b>activities</b> decreased. But in retrospective, that was so much better than today <i>(October in Lockdown 2020)</i>.

        Right from day one of college, we studied only when there was an internal exam. <i>(CA for those who know my college)</i> But, during the semesters one through three, I used to be upstairs all those CA days for studying.  Those were just 3 days which came hardly once a month (too less compared to older times). Suddenly, when Semester 5 started in lockdown, in a completely online way, we started having <b>test </b>or <b>CA</b> or <b> internship</b> test or <b>placement</b> prep </b> every single day. I was underperforming and wanted to try my luck with going upstairs and getting back the charm of School days and the earlier semesters. Soon, I was about to get surprises.

I realised how I lack natural light every single moment of my life these days. Getting shut in a room with devices which look better  when outside is dark (Especially in dark mode).  Then when I thought of taking some notes up for learning, not surprisingly, there were no physical books for learning, and alas, I took my laptop upstairs. I saw how I could not even see the LED light at side blinking. And it wasn't even sunny, it was almost dusk, around 6 in evening.  That was a sudden realisation of how darkness around had gotten so much into my life.

Night owls, dark room people out there! Beware we are losing so much out here. Listen to Songs on loudspeakers in home, Speak with your family, Ask stories of your parents and grandparents, don't ever get locked up in your room, Cook things with family and siblings, Play outdoor games, Go for a drive or ride.

        Enough of kidding that the world is on our palms, we will then soon be brought to our knees. Face real people, real things, rather than too much time with devices. I found sadly that almost everyone in my house use much of their time with devices. The world's so large and life's so short.<b> Let's not spend most of our lives with just silicon chips.</b>
