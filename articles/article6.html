            Ciao 2020!
            <h5 class="italicDate">4th January, 2021</h5>
        </div>
        <div class="text"><strong>Ciao 2020</strong>! So many people described 2020 as catastrophic, but I don&rsquo;t think it was that bad. It was a <em>rejuvenation</em>, a break, that too a surprising
            one. It was a reminder to the whole wide powerful and planning world, that sometimes all fool proof plans
            can fail; the entire world as we know it, can just become unrecognizable; <strong>for only change is
                permanent</strong>.</div>
        <div class="note set-aside blue">
            The bad news is time flies. The good news is you’re the pilot. Yet another year flew! </div>
        <div class="text">Coming back to 2020, the first quarter till March was so much like any other year, <em>same
                old classes, same old college, town bus travels, bakeries, restaurants, movie theatres</em> and what
            not. It falsely gave hope that everything would remain the same any day. I definitely wouldn't even have considered these worth noting, 
            if not for the pandemic. It just taught me, how we take things for granted. We never know the value of
            something until we are deprived of it.</div>
        <div class="text">Then, the <em>well-known panic phase</em>, March to May, was not so much different. Occasional
            <em>online classes, hoarding groceries, playing indoor games, listening to granny&rsquo;s stories again
                after so long, too many movies, books</em> and life went on. It was that much needed break for everyone
            on globe. But somehow, difference crept in, some people were so much affected, the small shopkeepers, the
            road vendors, the petty cash dealers, the theatre owners, the people whose lives and economies were
            shattered in a quarantine lifestyle. But of course, with it grew the kinds of people who were fast enough to
            adapt as situation demanded.&nbsp;</div>

        <div class="text">The next is my favourite part, &ldquo;<strong>the learning phase</strong>&rdquo; according to
            me. Coursera courses opened my way to study things no one compelled me to study. My own interests made me
            learn and try things, I never would have if there were no lockdown. <em>Cooking small recipes, learning
                vehicle riding, learning flower-tying, learning how things naturally worked from electricity to Internet
                connections, building a portfolio site and starting to blog,</em> somehow, I kept myself busy. I
            wondered why I didn&rsquo;t stay this inquisitive all my life. I was penitent that probably I had a set of
            wrong priorities all this time.&nbsp;</div>

        <div class="text">The ending of year 2020 along with my semester 5 was such a <strong>whirlwind</strong> taking us
            along without any strong purpose. I was a bit ill at ease towards the end. But as usual, the <em>Christmas Air,
                the New Year </em>brought <strong>hope and vigour. </strong>

            <div class="text">Actually, my observation this year, was that it was a<strong>&nbsp;well needed technology
                    upgradation</strong> for the entire world. The entire older generation became tech-savvy. The
                teachers from kindergarten to professors learnt <em>meet hacks, quiz creation and innovative ways of
                    teaching.</em> <em>Online exams and internet banking</em> were accepted by the last few people who
                still preferred offline exams and banks. New concepts of virtual weddings, functions and funerals came
                into existence. LOL! And, most importantly, people left their reckless ways and started
                becoming<em>&nbsp;hygienic</em>, wore masks at least for a few months.&nbsp;</div>
