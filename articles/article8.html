           An Incredible Journey
            <h5 class="italicDate">30th July, 2021</h5>
        </div>
        <div class="text">
           It all started when I applied for summer internship to various companies suggested by my college placement cell. When Microsoft came in, it was something special for every one out there. When I crossed small challenges like coding round, aptitude and technical MCQ, and came to the interview, I had the faintest idea that an incredible journey was on the verge of beginning. After some amazing and calm interviews, I got selected. I still remember that day. It was one with great excitement and pride. But little did I know about Microsoft then.

        <div class="text">
           I learnt so much about Microsoft. But most of all I liked the resilience. It moved from being the Windows focussed Microsoft to the modern one with Cloud, open source and variety of different products. It had updated itself and prevented getting outdated. It influenced me a lot.

           Something else mention-worthy is the people here. I had the opportunity to meet so many wonderful people: my buddies, my mentors, my team, my fellow interns, my manager and the entire workgroup. They were so approachable that it was like I already belonged there even before the internship had started. Countless events, intern day, leadership talks, wonderful books and other goodies and gifts. Life seemed smooth and contented. It seemed to stop wishing for more.

           Before the internship started, learning new technologies was maybe an overnight thing. At least, I thought we will be able to learn anything required in just a week or two. But continuous learning with growth mindset was something special I learnt from my mentors and buddies. They learnt along with us. Every day, we should never stop learning, telling the world you are an expert. You will have to learn because of your expertise which constantly reminds you how little you know. It was an incredible experience and a start to an incredible journey.
