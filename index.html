            <h1>My Interests</h1>
            <p>
              My hobbies and interests. some weirdness ahead too!  I guess interests come and go. We get crazy about certain things at certain periods of our life. I ll update my latest crazes here.

                I love history and mythology. Like epics and stories with too many twists in the plot. Probably that is why I read a lot of novels. I have recently been looking up World Wars, Cold Wars, Vietnam and Korean Wars and more about communism and Russia. The reason was Jeffrey Archer's novels primarily the Clifton Chronicles and Heads You Win. I was also looking up Plagues of 1800's due to the preveiling Corona Pandemic.
            </p>
            <p>
                I love secrets, codes and breaking them. Like recently I am addicted to cryptography, Encryption and Decryption and stuff.

              Some articles ahead. It won't be formal. I, like everyone else have a different writing style. It was very much influenced by my proud alma mater Avila Convent MHSS.
              I very much want to write a novel one day. I will add my daily musings in this section. It may be silent philosophy, the book reviews for what I read or something I 
              see which inspires me.
