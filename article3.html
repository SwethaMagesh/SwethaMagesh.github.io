    Why I read?

    One can’t just express what a novel does to you. It is just like a movie where you can choose the making, but not the story. It takes you away to eternal unreality. It is just really awesome how you become one with the book and trace the journey of the characters as if it is your journey. It is still mysterious how it could fill you with <b>better pictures and colours</b> than a movie. Books, they let you travel to most foreign of lands without moving your feet. It gets you quality happiness with benefits. It improves your vocabulary and language, it just does so without your being conscious of it.  Some other noteworthy miracles are how it surprises you when you find the new turn of story fit into everything before, and how what you had expected would not have made sense.  </div>

        You know you've read a good book when you turn the last page and feel a little as if you have lost a friend.
    </div>

<div class="text">
    You just marvel at the beauty of how the author weaved and <i>spun the tale with knots of thrilling twists</i>. Some other books are full of <i>emotion</i>, be it on romance, or on friendship, it makes one wish for such a friend or a brother or a love in one’s life. Some characters are relatable to those around us, while others make you yearn if you can meet such a character before you die. Some books make you cry, some feel new every time you them read again, some create such impact on you that you relate everything in daily life to that book and some stay forever stored in your mind that you remember most dialogues.

    Do not judge a book by its movie.
</div>
<div class="text">
    One other aspect is <i>books made into movies</i>- You simply can’t express your grief on how movies try in vain to portray a big novel in all its settings. A good book puts you in someone else’s shoes and makes you forget your pain, your works, especially those which are so demanding and vague. It destresses you for free and makes you smile when smile is rare. The one book which leaves readers crazy, is <i>the one which does not end properly</i>. It leaves you wondering, makes you search for every single fan-fiction in the world which is supposed to be that perfect end. Nothing would really fit in and it would forever be ending with that unfinished scene. Some wonderful plots would be spoilt with an extra-long boring write-up. But for a true reader, however unworthy the language is, however amateur the author is; however, the book is, it would ultimately earn your heart. You criticise the book, nevertheless <i>you can never really hate a book you fully read.</i>

<div class="text">
    <b>Libraries, book shops</b> – they simply make you stand in awe each time you see a huge collection of printed wisdom, which carry with it – the sleepless scribbles, the experience, pain, feelings of the writer, and the train of his thoughts along with compartments which complete the story. The smell of an old book, the complication of a classic which dances in front of you challenging and endearing you to read, the feeling of finishing a good book which you wish could have gone on forever can absolutely never be bought with all the gold in the world. How I wish I read all the books in the world.
