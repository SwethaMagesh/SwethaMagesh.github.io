   Remembering Cricket and MSD

    I can't exactly call myself a great cricket fan or the one who keeps track of every single game statistic at the tip of my fingers. But in India, Cricket is not just a sport but a religion. I have seen my dad start up conversation with relatives and others with just <q>What a match yesterday!</q> or something like that. 
    I guess I started watching cricket from 2011. 
    <i>World cups and IPL</i> were watched and followed regularly at home. Dad and me used to discuss scores and watch matches together. There were different phases - sometimes I used to watch ball by ball, but at other times I just discussed match results with classmates.
    </p>
    <br/>
    <div class="note set-aside blue" >
        Fortunately, school and college gave me so many friends who discussed cricket and there are some friends with whom I speak only about cricket
    </div>
    <p>
     Of course, sometimes I was involved in my daily chores and routines, and I wouldn't even notice a major tournament going on. Something I feel really bad is that, even in the peak of tenth and twelfth standards, I followed up cricket. (At least cricinfo commentary or the sports column the next day) But, these days, in college, I don’t find time for anything at all. It feels so bad to think about the forgotten hobbies. In the last two years, I have missed many tours and series altogether. I would almost completely blame <i>‘the-extremely-useful-all-controlling-mobile-phone’ </i>for it.
    </p>
    <br/>
    <p>
    Today I just thought I will remember MSD on his birthday. As soon as I think of Captain Cool, I remember so many things. (Bikes, Dogs, Milk--- forgive me for leaving out most nice ones) I'm not exactly a Dhoni fan or a fan of anyone else for that matter. I just love it when anyone hits well for their team.

    Something I really appreciate about Dhoni is his <i>wicketkeeping </i> skills. If I see Team India playing with Blue jerseys, I automatically visualise Dhoni behind the stumps. The way he does stumpings and run-outs astonished me beyond words. Something else I really liked about Dhoni was that, if he appeals for an <b>LBW</b> or a <b>Caught behind</b>, he is so genuine and it is almost surely an Out. He was so unlike countless others, who merely appealed for discouraging the batsman. Maybe many of you might remember so much other things like his <i>helicopter shots and finishing style</i>, but I just noted what really touched my heart. The movie <b>‘The Untold story’</b>, and one of my friends telling me <q>Sushant was more Dhonier than Dhoni himself</q> too comes into my mind when I ponder about the World Cup winning captain. 
    </p>

    If any ardent Cricket fan is reading it, do not get disappointed with the lack of 'fine crickety points' or references of CSK. I offer my justification here. First of all, being an inconsistent cricket watcher, I just wrote my first thoughts on seeing the countless statuses and posts on Dhoni today. It's just a momentary compilation of words (not a well thought out one). And during my school days, I hated to go with the crowd, when everyone likes something, I was indifferent about it. From that time, I was indifferent to CSK and enjoyed when it lost. (It was fun arguing with my dad and watching the match.) While he supported CSK, I supported its opponent impartially. So, CSK fans forgive me for the lack of CSK references. I watched IPL more than any other tournament and I like Dhoni so much too. (But just not CSK)

        Perhaps, I have other reasons, I am not telling!

    Actually, the movie <i> ‘M.S. Dhoni: The Untold Story’</i>, made me think of something which I had not given much thought before. That movie gave me a sudden insight into the fact that behind the confident captain, there has been a great struggle to get to that place from the small town of Ranchi (Especially considering how Mumbai dominates the Indian cricket world). Behind the successful and happy faces, there is always quite a great story. It is always a gentle reminder for us, to realise that <i>every single person high up in ladder, had never gotten there without achieving what seemed impossible</i>.
